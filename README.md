Project Descriptions for Various Business Problems
Business Problem 1: Lending Club Loan Analysis
Background:
The Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending site, makes anonymized data on loans and borrowers publicly available. The team aims to analyze this data to test several hypotheses regarding the factors affecting interest rates and creditworthiness.

Business Problem:
Using the Lending Club loans data, the team will test the following hypotheses:

Interest rates vary for different loan amounts (lower interest for higher loan amounts).
Loan length directly affects interest rates.
Interest rates vary for different loan purposes.
There is a relationship between FICO scores and home ownership status.
Data Available:

LoansData.csv: Contains variables such as Amount Requested, Amount Funded by Investors, Interest Rate, Loan Length, Loan Purpose, Debt to Income Ratio, State, Home Ownership, Monthly Income, FICO Range, Open Credit Lines, Revolving Credit Balance, Inquiries in the Last 6 Months, and Employment Length.
Project Description:
I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Lending Club loans data to understand how various factors influence interest rates and creditworthiness. Hypothesis testing was employed to validate or refute the proposed hypotheses. Insights from this analysis can help in understanding lending patterns and improving loan approval processes.

Business Problem 2: Pricing Process Variability
Background:
A small manufacturing company is concerned about the variability in price quotes provided by different pricing experts for unique customer orders. This variability could lead to inconsistencies and inefficiencies in the pricing process.

Business Problem:
The goal is to assess if there is any difference in the average price quotes provided by two pricing experts, Mary and Barry, for the same set of orders.

Data Available:

Price_Quotes.csv: Contains order numbers and price quotes from Mary and Barry for each order.
Project Description:
I performed a statistical analysis to compare the average price quotes provided by Mary and Barry. The analysis involved hypothesis testing to determine if there was a significant difference in their pricing approaches. This study aimed to identify and address inconsistencies in the pricing process, thereby improving overall pricing efficiency.

Business Problem 3: Effectiveness of Reengineering Efforts at New Life Residential Treatment Facility
Background:
New Life Residential Treatment Facility, which treats teenagers transitioning from psychiatric hospitals back into the community, implemented a reengineering program to lower behavioral problems and decrease employee turnover.

Business Problem:
Determine the effect of the reengineering effort on the incidence of behavioral problems and staff turnover. Specifically, assess if there was an improvement in the critical incident rate.

Data Available:

Treatment_Facility.csv: Contains 20 months of data, including whether the month was before or after reengineering, employee turnover percentage, TRFF (percentage of residents temporarily removed from the facility), and CI (percentage of critical incident reports).
Project Description:
I conducted a comprehensive analysis to evaluate the impact of the reengineering program on behavioral problems and staff turnover rates. The analysis included comparing pre- and post-reengineering periods to determine if the changes led to significant improvements. This study provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the reengineering efforts.

Business Problem 4: Prioritization System in Software Development Projects
Background:
ApDudes, a developer of tablet applications, struggled to meet project deadlines, with only 10% of projects completed on time and within budget. A new prioritization system was implemented to address these issues.

Business Problem:
Evaluate the effectiveness of the prioritization system by determining if high-priority jobs are completed more quickly than medium and low-priority jobs.

Data Available:

Priority_Assessment.csv: Contains data on the number of days taken to complete jobs and the priority level assigned to each job.
Project Description:
I analyzed the job completion times to assess the effectiveness of the prioritization system. By comparing the average completion times for high, medium, and low-priority jobs, I determined whether the new system effectively prioritized tasks and improved overall project timelines. This analysis helped in identifying areas for further process improvement.

Business Problem 5: Customer Satisfaction and Attendance at Film on the Rocks
Background:
Film on the Rocks is a summer movie series held at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. The promoters aim to increase attendance and improve customer satisfaction by understanding their audience better.

Business Problem:
Use survey results to address the following:

What is the overall level of customer satisfaction?
What factors are linked to satisfaction?
What is the demographic profile of patrons?
Which media outlets should be used for advertising?
Data Available:

Films.csv: Contains survey data with variables such as gender, marital status, age, income, how patrons heard about the event, and satisfaction ratings on various aspects.
Project Description:
I conducted an analysis of the survey data to evaluate customer satisfaction and identify factors influencing it. The study also profiled the demographics of attendees and assessed the effectiveness of different media outlets for advertising. Insights from this analysis helped in formulating strategies to enhance patron experience and optimize marketing efforts.
